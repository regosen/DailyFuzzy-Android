# Daily Fuzzy for Android

I've made Daily Fuzzy open-source!

Here is the source code for the Android app, which is available here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.regosen.dailyfuzzy

## Description

It's a simple gallery app that fetches images, gifs and videos from Reddit's r/aww subreddit, with some additional filtering by title (to weed out non-animal pictures and captions inappropriate for children).

This is my first Android project from scratch, and it contains some template code (as noted in some code comments).

## Features

- save images to your device
- track favorites and past images
- share on Facebook
- daily notifications
